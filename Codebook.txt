This Codebook modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
Dataset:Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0 downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR DatasetThis data set included the following files:

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The Code for run_analysis.R:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

Read activity files
dataActivityTest  reads 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels. 'data.frame':	2947 obs. of  1 variable
dataActivityTrain reads 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels. 'data.frame':	7352 obs. of  1 variable
Read subject files
dataSubjectTrain reads ‘subject_train.txt’: 'data.frame':	7352 obs. of  1 variable
dataSubjectTest  reads ‘subject_test.txt’: 'data.frame':	2947 obs. of  1 variable
Read features files
dataFeaturesTest  reads test/X_test.txt': Test set. 'data.frame':	2947 obs. of  561 variables
dataFeaturesTrain reads 'train/X_train.txt': Training set. 'data.frame':	7352 obs. of  561 variables

combine data tables by rows

dataSubject (10299 obs. of  1 variable) combined from ‘dataSubjectTrain’ and ‘dataSubjectTest’
dataActivity (10299 obs. of  1 variable)combined from ‘dataActivityTrain’ and ‘dataActivityTest’
dataFeatures (10299 obs. of  561 variables) combined from ‘dataFeaturesTrain and ‘dataFeaturesTest’

merge

mergeData (10299 obs. of  68 variables) merges ‘dataFeatures’ and ‘dataSubject’ and ‘dataActivity’

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
TidyData (10299 rows, 68 columns) is created by subsetting ‘mergeData’, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data setEntire numbers in code column of the TidyData replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variableAppropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable namescode column in TidyData renamed into activityAll Acc in column’s name replaced by AccelerometerAll Gyro in column’s name replaced by GyroscopeAll BodyBody in column’s name replaced by BodyAll Mag in column’s name replaced by MagnitudeAll start with character f in column’s name replaced by FrequencyAll start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time
All tBody with TimeBody
All -mean() with Mean
All -std() with STD
All -freq() with Frequency
All angle with Angle
All gravity with GravityFrom the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
IndependentTidyData (180 rows, 68 columns) is created by sumarizing TidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after grouped by subject and activity.Export IndependentTidyData into IndependentTidyData.txt file.
